LCM of two numbers a and b is given by, lcm=(a*b)/gcd(a,b), this does not hold good for more than 2 numbers. 
2 ways to find LCM for more than 2 numbers in python:
  1st way : using gcd func from math in python
            lcm=arr[0]
            for i in arr[1:]:
              lcm=lcm*i//gcd(lcm,i)
              
   2nd way : Without using gcd
              first find the lcm of arr[0] and arr[1]
              let x=arr[0] and y=arr[1]
              if x > y:  
                greater = x  
              else:  
                greater = y  
              while(True): //loops forever  
                if((greater % x == 0) and (greater % y == 0)):  
                    lcm = greater  
                     break  
                greater =  greater + 1
              
            repeat this function recursively by using a for loop to call the above func while passing (lcm,arr[i]) as parameters.
